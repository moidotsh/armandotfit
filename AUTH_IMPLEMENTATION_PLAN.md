# Authentication Implementation Plan - Armandotfit

## Code Audit Summary

### Current Architecture Analysis

**Tech Stack:**
- React Native with Expo Router
- Tamagui UI framework  
- AsyncStorage for local persistence
- TypeScript
- Context-based state management

**Key Findings:**

#### 1. Architecture Strengths
- Clean component-based architecture with good separation of concerns
- Well-structured context pattern for state management (`WorkoutDataContext`)
- Consistent theme system with responsive design considerations
- Proper TypeScript implementation throughout
- No existing backend/API dependencies (purely local data)

#### 2. Current Data Flow
- Local-only storage using AsyncStorage (`localWorkoutService`)
- Context providers for app-wide state management
- Direct component communication via props and context hooks
- No authentication or user management currently

#### 3. Areas Requiring Refactoring for Auth

##### State Management (`context/WorkoutDataContext.tsx:42-59`)
Current context needs user-scoped data isolation:
```typescript
interface WorkoutDataState {
  sessions: WorkoutSession[];
  userPreferences: UserPreferences;
  // Missing: userId, user profile, auth state
}
```

##### Data Service (`data/localWorkoutService.ts:4`)
Currently uses single storage key - needs user-scoped keys:
```typescript
const STORAGE_KEY = 'armandotfit_workout_data'; // Global key
```

##### Navigation (`navigation/NavigationHelper.tsx:8-13`)
Missing auth-protected routes:
```typescript
export enum NavigationPath {
  HOME = 'home',
  // Missing: LOGIN, REGISTER, PROFILE
}
```

##### Settings Screen (`app/settings.tsx:91-102`)
Profile management placeholder exists but not connected to auth system.

## Multi-Phased Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Authentication Foundation (1-2 weeks)

**Objectives:** Establish core auth infrastructure without disrupting existing functionality

**Tasks:**
1. **Create Auth Context & Types**
   - `context/AuthContext.tsx` with user state management
   - `types/auth.ts` for user/auth interfaces
   - Auth state: `unauthenticated`, `authenticated`, `loading`

2. **Add Auth Screens**
   - `app/auth/login.tsx` - Clean login form
   - `app/auth/register.tsx` - Registration with workout preferences
   - `app/auth/forgot-password.tsx` - Password recovery

3. **Route Protection Setup**
   - Update `app/_layout.tsx` with auth checks
   - Implement route guards for protected screens
   - Add redirect logic for unauthenticated users

4. **Local Auth Storage**
   - Extend `localWorkoutService` for user management
   - Add user session persistence
   - Implement logout functionality

**Deliverables:**
- Working login/register flow
- Protected routes
- User session management
- Backward compatibility maintained

### Phase 2: Data Isolation & User Management (1-2 weeks)

**Objectives:** Implement user-scoped data storage and profile management

**Tasks:**
1. **Refactor Data Service**
   - Modify `localWorkoutService` for user-scoped storage keys
   - Pattern: `armandotfit_user_{userId}_workout_data`
   - Add data migration utilities for existing users

2. **Enhance User Context**
   - Add user profile management to auth context
   - Implement user preferences synchronization
   - Add profile picture and personal details support

3. **Update Settings Integration**
   - Connect settings screen to auth context
   - Add profile editing capabilities
   - Implement account management features

4. **Workout Data Scoping**
   - Ensure all workout sessions are user-specific
   - Add user ID to workout session schema
   - Implement data export/import for users

**Deliverables:**
- User-scoped data storage
- Profile management
- Data migration tools
- Enhanced settings screen

### Phase 3: Advanced Features & Security (1-2 weeks)

**Objectives:** Add advanced auth features and security hardening

**Tasks:**
1. **Enhanced Security**
   - Add biometric authentication (where available)
   - Implement session timeout
   - Add secure storage for sensitive data
   - Input validation and sanitization

2. **Social Features Foundation**
   - User profile sharing
   - Workout statistics comparison
   - Basic social features framework

3. **Account Recovery & Management**
   - Email-based account recovery
   - Account deletion with data cleanup
   - Export user data functionality

4. **Offline-First Sync Preparation**
   - Design sync architecture for future backend
   - Add conflict resolution patterns
   - Implement optimistic updates

**Deliverables:**
- Hardened security
- Account recovery system
- Social features foundation
- Backend-ready architecture

### Phase 4: Backend Integration (Future) (2-3 weeks)

**Objectives:** Replace local storage with cloud backend when ready

**Tasks:**
1. **API Integration**
   - Choose backend service (Firebase, Supabase, custom)
   - Implement API service layer
   - Add offline sync capabilities

2. **Real-time Features**
   - Live workout sharing
   - Real-time progress updates
   - Push notifications

3. **Advanced Analytics**
   - Cloud-based workout analytics
   - Progress tracking across devices
   - Community features

## Recommended Refactoring Priorities

### High Priority
1. **User-scoped storage keys** in `localWorkoutService.ts`
2. **Auth context creation** with proper state management
3. **Route protection** in `_layout.tsx`
4. **Settings screen integration** with user profile

### Medium Priority
1. **Navigation helper updates** for auth routes
2. **Theme provider enhancements** for user preferences
3. **Component prop updates** for user-specific data
4. **Error boundary improvements** for auth errors

### Low Priority
1. **Performance optimizations** for auth state changes
2. **Advanced security features**
3. **Social features preparation**
4. **Accessibility improvements** for auth screens

---

## Architecture Decisions

**State Management:** Continue with Context API - it's working well and scales appropriately for this app size.

**Storage Strategy:** Extend current AsyncStorage approach with user scoping before moving to cloud backend.

**UI Consistency:** Leverage existing Tamagui theme system for auth screens to maintain design consistency.

**Migration Path:** Implement backward-compatible changes to avoid disrupting existing users.
